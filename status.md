Stage 9 (common library extraction) is done.
Stage 16–20 tools listed above are done.
elfbuilder: as64/ld64 build all current tools; instruction coverage expanded as needed.

## Shared utilities

- [src/utils.inc](src/utils.inc): `util_strlen`, `util_streq`, `util_memcpy`, `util_utoa`, `util_itoa`, `util_parse_int`, `util_parse_flags`.
- [src/syscalls.inc](src/syscalls.inc): syscall wrappers with fixed syscall numbers.
